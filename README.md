# Workout Creator

A Flutter project that allows users to create their own workouts.

## About

### Audience
* The targeted audience for this project is anyone who wants to be more organized and keep track of their workouts

### Functionality
* The app starts with an Example exercise already implemented
* The user can then either long press the Example to see its information, or they can add a new exercise
* To add a new exercise, the user must click the floating action button
  * When the floating action button is pressed, the user will be prompted with TextFields for them to edit
    * The 3 TextFields will have the Exercise name, the amount of sets, and the amount of reps
  * The user can then confirm the action by pressing the "Add" button
* The new exercise will then be added to the top of the list
* To view the information for the newly added exercise, all the user needs to do is long press that specific exercise
* Finally, to "finish" an exercise, all the user needs to do is simply tap that exercise and it will be greyed out
  * Note: tapping the greyed out workout will give it color and it will be back in the list

### Practicality
* This app is useful because it provides the opportunity for someone to keep track of a specific for the day
* The workout creator app removes the need for people to remember everything in their head
